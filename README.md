# Song-Popularity-Analysis :musical_note: :musical_keyboard: :musical_score:
The song popularity data analysis is a Kaggle competition project to understand the factors that may influence the popularity of a song. 

For this analysis, I have done the following;
- Data Cleaning
- Data filtering (to remove the missing values)
- Data visualization of the variables
- Classification of the variables into numeric, boolean and ordinal based on their features.
- Correlation analysis using a Heatmap.


At the end of the analysis, I found some interesting information;

- There was only minor differences between the feautures of popular and unpopular songs.
- About 36% of the songs are popular, while 63% of the songs are not.
- None of the features individually show a notable correlation with "song popularity", the target variable.
- There's a strong correlation between energy and loudness, at 0.92.

This is the part one. In the next part, I will be train a machine learning model, to be able to predict song popularity based on all the variables given.

Please, stay tuned.
